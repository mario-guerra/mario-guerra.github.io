# Qdrant Developer Relations Strategy Draft


> **A comprehensive roadmap for building a world-class developer community around Qdrant's vector database platform, written from an outsider's perspective**

> **Disclaimer:** This strategy draft was created in a short timeframe using only publicly available information. It is intended to demonstrate my approach to DevRel planning and strategic thinking for the Qdrant platform. With access to internal data, team input, and more time, a full plan would be significantly more comprehensive and tailored to Qdrant’s unique needs.



## Understanding Qdrant's Opportunity

Qdrant stands out for its **high performance**, **open-source foundation**, and **growing reputation** in the AI and vector database space. Developers love its speed, reliability, and ease of use. However, there are opportunities to further improve the developer experience, especially around UI, visualization, and onboarding. The competitive landscape is evolving quickly, so our strategy must be both bold and responsive.
