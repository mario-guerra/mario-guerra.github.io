      “I worked with Mario on the strategic positioning of TypeSpec, its features, use cases, and adoption for a few years. Mario was always curious and interested in learning and drove issues through to completion. He really embraced AI and was constantly pushing its limits. I loved learning about this from him.” — Jeffrey Richter, Partner Software Architect at Microsoft

      "Mario stands out as a thoughtful, intellectually curious, and deeply committed product leader who consistently raised the bar for technical excellence and cross-team collaboration.
      What sets Mario apart, is his learning agility and initiative, especially in emerging areas like AI. He was the first on our team to deeply explore LLMs, even spinning up and managing our own Azure SDK internal ChatGPT instance to accelerate experimentation. He consistently shared insights, tools, and best practices, proactively raising the team's collective understanding and positioning us to better support AI developers at scale." — Justin Bettencourt, Principal Manager of Product Management at Microsoft

      “Mario's passion for AI is second to none, and in fact he was one of the people that got me thinking more deeply about how to use AI in the TypeSpec area (and, in general, in my workflow), for which I'm very grateful. But what I really like about Mario is that he's always looking for feedback on how to do *more* -- he's got a growth-focused mind and is always looking for something new to learn and work with.” — Matthew Gertz, Principal Software Architect at Microsoft

      “[Mario] consistently impressed as a Product Manager with deep expertise in AI platforms, API frameworks, and developer tools. Mario brings a rare combination of technical depth and strategic vision, which he applied masterfully while leading the product direction for TypeSpec—an open-source API definition language that’s reshaping how developers design APIs.” — Scott Addie, Azure Developer Experience at Microsoft

      “I worked with Mario a few years ago on a difficult UX research project. We were trying to learn more from Rust developers about how they build cloud applications. Mario had a great idea of using a survey to learn about how different developer demographics influence the topics that were most important to the developers. With the results of the survey we were able to create a much better set of customer hypotheses and discussion guides which meant our interviews were much more valuable than had we just gone in cold.” — Steven Clarke, Principal User Experience Researcher at Microsoft
