Are you interested in landing a remote work job in the 2020s? So was I. After 20+ years working as a software engineer in a typical office environment, I wanted to make some big changes.

Here’s what I learned from re-entering the job market after 13 years with the same company.

## Intro

There are tech jobs aplenty right now, and many of them offer a remote work option. However, it took me over seven months to find and get a job I really wanted. That’s mainly because there are caveats that made my job search more difficult.

First, I was looking to make a transition from software engineering to either a product management or software architect role. This kind of change is not easy to do, especially when moving from one company to another.

Second, I wanted a senior-level opportunity that would allow me to work fully remote, even after the pandemic ends. I had to turn down some opportunities as a result, and many companies would not even consider the option. I believe the future of work will require employers to be more flexible to stay competitive, but not all have caught on to that fact yet.

Third, as a systems software engineer (compilers, simulators, and RTOS type stuff), my software skills were out of step with today’s cloud development tools and techniques. This is relevant because nearly every role I applied to required at least some knowledge of cloud computing or cloud architecture best practices.

So here’s what I did that helped me…

## Keep track of everything

I applied to 128 different jobs over the course of seven months. Not counting phone screens with company recruiters, eight of those applications resulted in interviews.

Of those eight interviews, four resulted in job offers, one of which I accepted.

I have this information because I tracked every application in a spreadsheet. My spreadsheet included these columns:

- Application date
- Company name
- Company core business
- Position/Title
- Link to job description
- Contacted
- Screened
- Interviewed
- Offer
- Notes

Recording my applications kept me from applying to the same roles and allowed me to track the companies who contacted me. If I was contacted two or three months later, as was often the case, I was able to refer back to the job description to refresh my memory on what they were looking for.

## Optimize your resume for ATS

There’s plenty of content available on how to build a good resume, so I’m not going to rehash that topic. Instead, I’m going to focus on what you need to do to avoid having your resume filtered out before anyone ever sees it.

Nearly every tech company I applied to uses an [applicant tracking system](https://www.jobscan.co/blog/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-applicant-tracking-systems/) (ATS). These systems automatically parse the text of your resume to extract the relevant information for insertion into a searchable database. They may also rank your resume in comparison to other applicants that applied for the same role.

### Simple text layout

ATS programs are sophisticated, but they still have trouble properly parsing non-standard document elements like columns, tables, and decoration.

### Basic font

I originally used Calibri as the base font for my resume because I like the way it looks. Unfortunately, I found that several applicant tracking systems had problems parsing my resume text correctly.

### Keyword density

Keyword density is crucial for maximizing your chances of appearing in searches done by corporate recruiters and hiring managers in an ATS.

### Restate the job description

I made a point of carefully reading each job description and adding relevant phrases that matched my experience to the ‘Highlights’ section of my resume.

## Build your personal brand

One of the best pieces of advice I received was to build my personal brand.

### Define your skillset

Defining my skills and interests helped me clarify what I wanted out of the next 20 years of my career.

### Create your elevator pitch

Create an elevator pitch about who you are that you can deliver in under two minutes.

## Be prepared

Once you’ve made it to an interview, you’ve got one chance to show them your value.

### Have good answers

Take the time to think through and write out answers to the most common interview questions.

### Ask good questions

A good interviewer will always leave time for you to ask questions.

### Do your research

Before interviewing, take time to do as much research on the company as you can.
