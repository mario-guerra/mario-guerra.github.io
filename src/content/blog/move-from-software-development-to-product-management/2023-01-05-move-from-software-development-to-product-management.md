# Hacking Your Way into Product Management: A Software Developer’s Guide

Are you a software developer thinking about making the switch to product management? If so, you’re not alone. A lot of developers find that they really enjoy the strategic thinking and leadership aspects of product management and decide to make the switch.

But what does it take to make the switch? And are you a good fit for product management?

In this article, I’ll explore the skills needed for product management after a background in software development, the advantages of switching, and tips for software developers looking to move into product management.

## Transitioning from software development to product management

First off, let’s talk about the differences between software development and product management. As a software developer, you’re responsible for writing, building, and testing code. You might work on a single feature or be part of a team working on a big project. You spend a lot of time coding, testing, and debugging.

Product management is all about overseeing the design of a product, sometimes from start to finish and sometimes as an ongoing effort. You’ll work with many different stakeholders to define a product roadmap, decide which features to prioritize, and make sure the final product meets the needs of your customers. You’ll work individually and in partnership with other PMs to define, develop, and direct plans for the creation and release of a product.

## Product manager vs. software developer: which is right for me?

You might be wondering – how do I know if a switch from software development to product management is right for me?

In my case, after twenty years in the systems software space, I came to the realization that I enjoyed the process of *defining* a product more than I enjoyed the process of *developing* a product. I also enjoyed talking to customers and helping them solve problems more than I liked coding, testing, and debugging.

Don’t get me wrong, I do enjoy coding, but I find that I enjoy it a lot more now that I do it as a learning endeavor rather than as a career. For the first time in my career, I’m learning new languages (Rust, C#, Java) and I now have a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/mario-guerra) with some of my learning projects. Granted, there’s not a lot there at the time I’m writing this, but it will grow with time!

## Skills needed for product management after software development

So, what skills do you need to make the switch from software development to product management?

- **Excellent communication skills** are an absolute must. As a product manager, you’ll be constantly talking with engineers, other product managers, and most importantly, customers! You need to be able to listen carefully, especially to customers, and ask thoughtful questions to get to the underlying issues.

- **Presentation and persuasion skills.** You’ll spend a lot of time crafting and presenting documentation that supports your vision for what the engineering teams ought to be doing. Sometimes they won’t want to do what you think they ought to, for various reasons. You need to be able to work with these teams to understand their concerns and talk them through why your vision is the right path to follow.

- **Strategic thinking and decision-making.** Product management is all about finding the right balance between what’s best for the business and what’s best for the customer, which means sometimes making tough choices.

- **Understanding your customers.** You need to know what your target market needs and where they’re struggling. This involves talking to customers and staying updated on the latest developments in your industry.

## Preparing for a career move from software development to product management

If you’re a software developer interested in transitioning to product management, consider taking some training programs or courses to help you develop these skills. 

Taking training shows potential employers that you’re serious about making the transition. Additionally, spend time crafting your resume and building your personal brand. I’ve covered this extensively in my [post on finding remote work](https://marioguerra.xyz/finding-remote-work-in-the-2020s/).

## Advantages of moving from software development to product management

There are advantages to switching from software development to product management. In my experience, product management jobs often have more opportunities for advancement and allow for work on a broader variety of projects and industries.

For example, at Microsoft, where I work in the Developer Division (DevDiv), the focus is on creating and maintaining the best experience possible for developers. I’m constantly exposed to new technology and products, and Microsoft is very supportive of internal career moves.

If you’re interested in product management at Microsoft, I recommend the following books:

- [The Customer Driven Playbook](https://amzn.to/3QriCIg)  
- [The Customer Driven Culture](https://amzn.to/3ik2HP6)

These books are broadly applicable to product management and especially relevant to how we do things at Microsoft.

## Is switching from software engineering to product management right for you?

If you love strategic thinking, have strong communication skills, and are passionate about creating products that solve real problems for customers, product management might be a great fit.

Start building your product management skills now by taking courses, volunteering for product management responsibilities, or networking with product managers to learn more. Talking to PMs at your current company can also give you valuable insight and might lead to an internal role.

By taking these steps, you’ll be well-prepared to make the transition from software development to product management and embark on a new and rewarding career.
