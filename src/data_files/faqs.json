      "question": "What is TypeSpec?",
      "answer": "TypeSpec is a language for designing APIs. It enables teams to describe their APIs in a clear, concise manner that can be used to generate documentation, client libraries, and server implementations in multiple programming languages. It helps ensure consistency and quality across API development."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does TypeSpec improve developer productivity?",
      "answer": "TypeSpec enhances developer productivity by providing a single source of truth for API design, reducing inconsistencies, automating code generation, and simplifying documentation. This allows developers to focus on business logic rather than API boilerplate code and cross-language compatibility."
